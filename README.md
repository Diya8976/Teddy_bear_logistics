# 🧸 AI-Powered Teddy Bear Logistics Tracking System

An industrial-level AI/ML project that simulates smart logistics management for teddy bear deliveries. This system combines real-time tracking, delivery performance monitoring, anomaly detection, fraud prevention, and dashboard visualization — built from scratch using Python, Streamlit, ML models, and geospatial tools.

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 **Attendance Tracking** – Tracks teddy bear entry/exit in warehouse using simulated RFID data.
- 🚚 **Delivery Prediction** – Predicts expected vs actual delivery time using XGBoost and regression models.
- 📊 **Demand Forecasting** – Forecasts teddy bear demand using LSTM/Prophet time series models.
- 🗺️ **Location & Geofencing** – Tracks teddy bears via GPS coordinates and geofencing alerts using Geopy.
- 🎥 **CCTV-Based Tracking** – Detects teddy bears using object detection models (YOLO/OpenCV).
- 🔍 **Fraud Detection** – Detects fake deliveries, duplicate orders, and suspicious patterns using Isolation Forest and Neo4j.
- 💬 **Email Alerts** – Sends intelligent HTML email alerts when fraud or failure is detected.
- 📈 **Interactive Dashboard** – Built using Streamlit to visualize attendance, deliveries, and anomalies.
